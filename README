This patcher is created by brightidea and I'm simply posting his sources on my github account.

This utility takes only one argument: <path to libwebcore.so> and should spit out two files: libwebcore.so and lib__core.so. It also backs up the current libwebcore.so file in case you want to revert back.

These newly created files should render Arabic text correctly in the default Browser and Gmail app in Android <= 2.3.x



To compile 3.91B of the patcher in Linux:

gcc -D_7ZIP_ST webkit_arabic_patch.c C/LzmaLib.c C/Alloc.c C/LzmaEnc.c C/LzmaDec.c C/LzFind.c -o webkit

The Lzma library that we're linking against is included in the repo (i.e. lzma920.tar.bz2 )
